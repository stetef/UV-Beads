# Ultraviolet (UV) beads, Extended Lesson
This activity covers concepts such as the elctromagnetic spectrum and how light interacts with matter. Additionally, it discusses how UV beads work and guides experiments around that concept.

### Goal: To demonstrate how different nanoscale properties can impact macroscale properties (such as color).
### Background knowledge required:
1. The model of an atom
2. Bonding
3. How to draw the structure of a molecule
4. Simple algebra

### For teachers and administrators:
Lesson plans are in the `Lesson Plans` folder. The notebook is divided into two activities:
1. UV Beads (requires physical supplies)
2. Nanoparticle Color (requires the Jupyter notebook)

While the second lesson -- Nanoparticle Color (the focus of the Jupyter Notebook) -- builds off of concepts in the first UV Beads lesson, it *can* be done independently of that lesson.

### For students:
To run the activity in your browser, open up the Jupyter notebook using Binder...
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stetef/UV-Beads.git/HEAD)

### For tech savvy enthusiasts:
You can clone this repo and run the notebook locally by typing

`git clone https://github.com/stetef/UV-Beads.git`

in your terminal.
